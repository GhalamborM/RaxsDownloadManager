# Raxs Download Manager (RD) — Privacy Policy
Effective date: 2025-10-20

This Privacy Policy explains how Raxs Download Manager (“RD”) and its optional browser extensions for Chrome/Edge handle information. RD is a desktop application; the extensions provide a “Download with RD” shortcut and communicate with the app on your device. This document describes data handling in the product as implemented in the codebase. It is not legal advice.

## Scope
- RD desktop application for Windows.
- RD browser extensions (Chrome/Edge) that integrate with RD via Native Messaging.

## What We Process
When you use the “Download with RD” action:
- Download URL you select or send.
- Optional filename derived from the URL path.
- Timestamp generated by the extension.

No account data, browsing history, cookies, page content, or personal identifiers are collected by RD for this feature.

## How We Use the Data
- The URL (and optional filename) are sent from the extension to the RD desktop app on your machine to add a download.
- RD uses the URL to connect to the destination server and download the content you requested.

## Where Data Flows and Is Stored
- On-device only: The extension and RD communicate locally using Native Messaging and a named pipe (`RaxsDownloadManagerPipe`). Messages are simple JSON.
- RD may store download tasks and related metadata locally on your device (e.g., URL, filename, progress, status). This storage is not transmitted to RD servers.
- No telemetry or analytics are sent by RD or the extension.

## Browser Permissions (What and Why)
- contextMenus: Shows “Download with RD” when you right-click links/media or selected text.
- nativeMessaging: Allows the extension to talk to the RD app via a local native host.
- host_permissions: `<all_urls>` enables the context menu to appear across sites and pass selected link/media URLs to RD.
- notifications (optional): Used to show success/failure notices after sending a URL to RD.

These permissions do not grant RD the ability to read your browsing history or page content automatically.

## Sharing and Third Parties
- RD does not sell or share your data with third parties.
- The URL you chose is contacted by RD to download the requested content (i.e., the target site receives a request as part of normal downloading).

## Security
- Local-only communication between the extension and RD via Native Messaging and named pipes.
- No cloud relays are used for this integration.
- Standard Windows process boundaries apply. Keep your system up to date to maintain security.

## Children’s Privacy
RD is not directed to children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Logs
- RD may write diagnostic information to local debug logs or the console to troubleshoot integration. These logs are not transmitted by RD.

## Open Source and Transparency
Parts of RD and its extensions are available on GitHub: https://github.com/RaxsStudio/RaxsDownloadManager. You can review how data is handled in the source.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect improvements or changes in RD. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Effective date.”
